# Algorithmic Challenges from the CSES Problem Set and More

### Overview

This portfolio displays a collection of elementary problems I tackled from the famous **CSES Problem Set**. The goal of this repository is to showcase
the range of my **Algorithmic Problem Solving** knowledge, as well as to demonstrate the methology I use when it comes to Competitive Programming Training.
Additionally, the viewer may also find a collection of **Advanced Problems** that I selected from multiple platforms. These problems are to demonstrate how challanging
these topics can get in competitions.

### Problem Categories

Advanced Problems  
Sorting and Searching  
Dynamic Programming  
Graph/Tree Algorithms  
Range Queries  
Mathematics    
Geometry   

### Additional Clarification for the Viewer

Most of the problems are picked from the CSES Problem Set. Note that, all codes in this repository have been written using a ******C++****** syntax.
Inside the codes, the viewer may find the name of the problem as well as links to the website. Although the codes are primarily written in English, some
of them may feature Hungarian names for variables or functions. I have not adressed this problem as I beleive this reflects my evolving coding style.
