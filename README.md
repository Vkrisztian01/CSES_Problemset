# Algorithmic Challenges from the CSES Problem Set

### Overview

This portfolio displays a collection of problems I tackled from the famous **CSES Problem Set**. The goal of this repository is to showcase
my **Algorithmic Problem Solving** skills, as well as to demonstrate the methology I use when it comes to Competitive Programming Training.

### Problem Categories

Sorting and Searching  
Dynamic Programming  
Graph/Tree Algorithms  
Range Queries  
Mathematics    
Geometry   

### Additional Clarification for the Viewer

All problems are picked from the CSES Problem Set. Note that, all codes in this repository has been written using a ******C++****** syntax.
Inside the codes, the viewer may find the name of the problem as well as links to the website. Althogh the codes are primarily written in English, some
of them may feature Hungarian names for variables or functions. I have not adressed this problem as I beleive this reflects my evolving coding style.
